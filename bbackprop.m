% backprop a per-epoch backpropagation training for a multilayer feedforward
%          neural network.
%   Network = bbackprop(Layers,N,M,SatisfactoryMSE,Input,Desired) 
%   returns Network, a structure having the fields:
%     structure - vector of number of nodes at each layer
%     weights - a cell array specifiying the final weight matrices computed
%     epochs - the epochs required for training
%     mse - the mean squared error at termination
%   weights is a cell array specifying the final weight matrices computed by 
%   minimizing the mean squared error between the Desired output and the 
%   actual output of the network given a set of training samples: Input and 
%   the SatisfactoryMSE (satisfactory mean squared error) 
%
%   Input:
%    Layers - a vector of integers specifying the number of nodes at each
%     layer, i.e for all i, Layers(i) = number of nodes at layer i, there
%     must be at least three layers and the input layer Layers(1) must
%     equal the dimension of each vector in Input, likewise, Layers(end) 
%     must be equal to the dimension of each vector in Desired
%     N - training rate for network learning [0.1 - 0.9]
%     M - momentum for the weight update rule [0.0 - 0.9]
%     SatisfactoryMSE - the mse at which to terminate computation
%     Input - the training samples, a P-by-N matrix, where each Input[p] is
%      a training vector
%     Desired - the desired outputs, a P-by-M matrix where each Desired[p]
%      is the desired output for the corresponding input Input[p]
%
%   This algorithm uses the hyperbolic tangent node function 
%   2/(1+e^(-net)) - 1, suitable for use with bipolar data
%   
%   NOTE: due to its generality this algorithm is not as efficient as a 
%   one designed for a specific problem. If the number of desired layers is 
%   known ahead of time, it is better to a) remove the use of cells for the
%   weight matrices and explicitly create the number of desired weight matrices
%   and 'unfold' the loops inside the presentation loop. That is, explicitly 
%   calculate the input and output of each each layer one by one and subsequently 
%   the modified error and weight matrix modifications b) remove calculation of 
%   momentum if it is not required

% is a weight matrix between each layer of nodes. Each layer (exclusive the

% in layer i to the bias node in layer j (the last row of each matrix)
% because it is less computationally expensive then the alternative. The

%%%%% PREALLOCATION PHASE %%%%%
% for faster computation preallocate activation,net,prev_w and sum_w

% Activation: there is an activation matrix a{i} for each layer in the 
% network such that a{1} = the network input and a{end} = network output
% Since we're doing batch mode, each activation matrix a{i} is a 
% P-by-K (P=num of samples,K=nodes at layer i) matrix such that 
% a{i}(j) denotes the activation vector of layer i for the jth input and 
% a{i}(j,k) is the activation(output) of the kth node in layer i for the jth 
% input
a = cell(nLayers,1);  % one activation matrix for each layer
a{1} = [X ones(P,1)]; % a{1} is the input + '1' for the bias node activation
                      % a{1} remains the same throught the computation
for i=2:nLayers-1
    a{i} = ones(P,L(i)+1); % inner layers include a bias node (P-by-Nodes+1) 
end
a{end} = ones(P,L(end));   % no bias node at output layer

% Net: like activation, there is a net matrix net{i} for each layer
% exclusive the input such that net{i} = sum(w(i,j) * a(j)) for j = i-1
% and each net matrix net{i} is a P-by-K matrix such that net{i}(j) denotes 
% the net vector at layer i for the jth sample and net{i}(j,k) denotes the
% net input at node k of the ith layer for the jth sample
net = cell(nLayers-1,1); % one net matrix for each layer exclusive input
for i=1:nLayers-2;
    net{i} = ones(P,L(i+1)+1); % affix bias node 
end
net{end} = ones(P,L(end));

% Since we're using batch mode and momentum, two additional matrices are
% needed: prev_dw is the delta weight matrices at time (t-1) and sum_dw
% is the sum of the delta weights for each presentation of the input
% the notation here is the same as net and activation, that is prev_dw{i} 
% is P-by-K matrix where prev_dw{i} is the delta weight matrix for all samples 
% at time (t-1) and sum_dw{i} is a P-by-K matrix where sum_dw{i} is the
% the sum of the weight matrix at layer i for all samples
prev_dw = cell(nLayers-1,1);
sum_dw = cell(nLayers-1,1);

    sum_dw{i} = zeros(size(w{i}));
end

% training

    % then starting at the output layer, calculate the sum of the weight
